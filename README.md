 Featured Projects

 ðŸ“ˆ [Quantifying the Impact of Economic Policy: A Data-Driven Analysis of EU GDP & Inflation]
 (https://github.com/mahirmohamed/eurostat-analysis)
Analyzed Eurostat GDP and inflation data across EU countries to explore fiscal policy impacts.

Key Achievements:
- Cleaned and reshaped 10,000+ rows of quarterly economic data using Python and Pandas
- Calculated growth rates and indexed time-series (2008Q1=100 baseline)
- Created multi-country comparative visualizations revealing spending-inflation relationships
- Delivered analytical report connecting statistical findings to macroeconomic theory

Tech Stack: `Python` `Pandas` `Matplotlib` `Eurostat API`

 [Identifying the True Health of an Economy: Why Ireland's GDP Growth Misrepresents Domestic Consumer Strength]
(https://github.com/mahirmohamed/ireland-gdp-analysis)
Investigated the disconnect between Ireland's GDP growth and domestic consumption patterns.

Key Achievements:
- Built comparative index analysis showing 40%+ gap between GDP and consumption growth post-2014
- Demonstrated how multinational accounting practices inflated Ireland's GDP figures
- Provided evidence-based critique of GDP as a sole wellbeing indicator

Tech Stack: `Python` `Matplotlib` `Excel`

 [Post-COVID Inflation Study](https://github.com/mahirmohamed/inflation-analysis)
Examined 2022 inflation patterns across European economies and their drivers.

Key Achievements:
- Analyzed year-on-year core inflation data for 27 EU countries
- Created ranked visualizations highlighting inflation outliers
- Assessed relationship between fiscal expansion and inflation outcomes
- Concluded supply-side shocks were primary inflation drivers, not government spending

Tech Stack: `Python` `Seaborn` `Eurostat API`

 [Econometric Simulation: OLS vs 2SLS Estimation](https://github.com/mahirmohamed/econometrics-simulation)
Advanced statistical simulation demonstrating instrumental variable methods for causal inference.

Key Achievements:
- Simulated data generating process with 1,000 observations using multivariate normal distributions
- Implemented OLS and Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) regression to address endogeneity bias
- Conducted Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 replications proving 2SLS unbiased (mean â‰ˆ 50.00) vs. biased OLS (mean â‰ˆ 50.76)
- Performed comprehensive residual diagnostics (Shapiro-Wilk, Breusch-Pagan tests)
- Created multi-panel visualizations comparing population parameters with estimation results

Tech Stack: `R` `ggplot2` `MASS` `AER` `lmtest` `sandwich`

 [Time Series Analysis: US Inflation & Capacity Utilization](https://github.com/mahirmohamed/inflation-capacity-vecm)
Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) analysis exploring dynamic relationships in macroeconomic indicators.

Key Achievements:
- Analyzed 702 monthly observations (1967-2025) from FRED database using advanced time series econometrics
- Conducted unit root testing (ADF, Phillips-Perron, KPSS) confirming both series integrated of order I(1)
- Performed Johansen cointegration analysis identifying one cointegrating relationship between variables
- Built VECM framework capturing short-run dynamics and long-run equilibrium adjustments
- Generated impulse response functions showing capacity shocks persist 12+ months in affecting inflation
- Implemented Granger causality tests revealing bidirectional feedback between industrial activity and prices
- Developed ARIMA(2,0,0)(2,1,0)[12] forecasting model with comprehensive diagnostic testing

Tech Stack: `R` `urca` `vars` `forecast` `dynlm` `ggplot2` `pdfetch`

  Background

My analytical foundation comes from projects at Goldsmiths, University of London, where I integrated advanced statistical programming with economic theory. Through coursework in econometrics and data analysis, I developed skills in:
- Working with real-world, imperfect datasets from sources like FRED and Eurostat
- Applying rigorous statistical methods to answer research questions
- Translating complex technical findings into clear, actionable insights
- Building reproducible analysis pipelines in both Python and R

This combination of technical rigor and practical application prepared me to tackle data challenges in business contexts.
